# interfaze-agent Implementation Spec 

## API Routes and Frontend Structure

## 1. Core Implementation Decision

interfaze-agent will be built by editing and rebranding the existing Hermes source code.

Hermes should not stay as a separate external dependency. Instead:

```text
Hermes source code
        ↓
Fork / internal repo
        ↓
Rename product layer to interfaze-agent
        ↓
Keep agent runtime, tools, skills, gateway concepts
        ↓
Replace generic agent UI with B2B SaaS sales-agent interface
```

## 2. Product Behavior Changes

### MVP now supports

* Multi-company SaaS
* Admin-managed customers
* Company onboarding
* Internal company data ingestion
* Past sales and contact data ingestion
* Lead discovery
* Map-based country selection
* Lead research
* Contact discovery
* Custom lead creation
* Custom cold email generation
* Real cold email sending after approval
* Gmail / Google Workspace integration
* Microsoft 365 / Exchange integration
* WhatsApp Business integration
* LinkedIn profile finding and note generation
* CSV export
* Sales analytics
* Market intelligence analytics

### Important email behavior

The MVP should support both:

```text
1. Draft mode
2. Approved send mode
```

Draft mode is safer and should be the default. Approved send mode is required for custom-lead cold emails.

For Gmail, the API supports both creating drafts and sending messages; Gmail also supports sending from a draft.

For Microsoft 365 / Exchange Online, Microsoft Graph supports creating draft messages and sending mail.

# 3. Email Provider Support Versions

## Email Provider MVP — v1.0

Required:

```text
Google Workspace / Gmail
Microsoft 365 / Outlook / Exchange Online
```

Behavior:

* One company connects one main salesperson mailbox.
* Emails are sent from that connected salesperson mailbox.
* Other provided company emails can be added to CC.
* CC behavior can be configured by country, market, product, or campaign.

Example:

```text
Germany campaign:
From: sales@silverline.com
CC: export@silverline.com, germany@silverline.com

UAE campaign:
From: sales@silverline.com
CC: mena@silverline.com
```

## Email Provider v1.1

Add:

```text
Zoho Mail
Generic SMTP
```

Zoho has OAuth-based Mail APIs and draft/send workflows, so it is a reasonable next provider after Gmail and Microsoft.

Generic SMTP should be treated as a fallback, not the preferred option.

## Email Provider v1.2

Add managed sending providers:

```text
Resend
Mailgun
SendGrid
Brevo
Amazon SES
```

These are useful for platform-managed sending, but they are not ideal for “send from the actual salesperson mailbox” unless domain authentication and sender identity are configured correctly. Resend and Mailgun both expose email sending APIs.

## Email provider architecture

Use a provider adapter interface:

```text
email_providers/
  base.py
  gmail_provider.py
  microsoft_provider.py
  zoho_provider.py
  smtp_provider.py
  resend_provider.py
  mailgun_provider.py
```

Each provider should implement:

```text
connect_account()
refresh_token()
create_draft()
send_email()
send_draft()
get_message_status()
list_recent_replies()
disconnect_account()
```

---

# 4. WhatsApp Business Requirement

Customers must create or provide access to their own WhatsApp Business account.

The product should not use a personal WhatsApp Web automation flow. It should use WhatsApp Business Platform / Cloud API. Meta’s developer resources describe the WhatsApp Business Platform as the supported integration path for scalable business messaging.

## WhatsApp MVP behavior

```text
Customer creates WhatsApp Business account
        ↓
Customer connects phone number / business account
        ↓
interfaze-agent stores integration status
        ↓
System generates message
        ↓
User approves
        ↓
System sends through WhatsApp Business API
```

## WhatsApp onboarding fields

```text
business_name
whatsapp_business_account_id
phone_number_id
display_phone_number
business_country
default_language
template_status
webhook_verify_token
access_token_encrypted
```

---

# 5. LinkedIn Implementation Decision

For MVP, LinkedIn should support:

```text
Profile discovery
LinkedIn URL storage
Connection note generation
Manual open profile action
Manual status update
```

Do not ship automated LinkedIn connection requests through browser automation in the SaaS MVP unless you later confirm a compliant integration path. LinkedIn’s User Agreement prohibits scripts, robots, crawlers, browser plugins, or other technology used to scrape/copy LinkedIn services, and also prohibits unauthorized automated methods to add/download contacts or send messages.

So MVP behavior should be:

```text
Find LinkedIn profile
        ↓
Store URL
        ↓
Generate note
        ↓
User opens LinkedIn manually
        ↓
User sends connection request manually
        ↓
User marks status in interfaze-agent
```

---

# 6. Customer Onboarding Requirements

The onboarding must define the company deeply, not just collect basic profile info.

**Where these fields land, and what enforces them.** Onboarding writes company
sections through one function, `_put_section` in `server/routes/company.py`, and
`schemas.SECTION_FIELDS` decides which keys each section accepts. A field this
document names but the section does not define is a 422 with the offending key
named — not a silent write. That matters more here than it looks: every section
is handed to the model wholesale by `AgentRunService.company_context`, so an
unvalidated typo does not disappear, it becomes context.

The four subsections below are not all the same kind of thing:

```text
6.1 Company identity   -> section 'profile'      keys, validated
6.2 Company positioning-> section 'positioning'  keys, validated
6.3 Product data       -> products.data          per-product, open by design
6.4 Internal sales data-> uploaded documents     DOCUMENT_TYPES in knowledge.py
6.5 Current contact data-> uploaded documents    DOCUMENT_TYPES in knowledge.py
```

§6.1 and §6.2 are field lists, and `tests/server/test_onboarding_contract.py`
asserts that every name printed below is accepted by its section — edit one side
and the other fails. §6.3 stays open because a product catalog carries columns
nobody enumerated in advance (`product_import._parse_row` keeps them as
`extra`), and rejecting them would reject valid imports. §6.4 and §6.5 are
upload categories rather than fields: the customer supplies them as documents,
and `DOCUMENT_TYPES` is the list that actually gates them. It does not yet cover
every category named here — `active_deals`, `previous_outreach`,
`country_revenue_breakdown`, `customer_segments`, `average_order_value`,
`sales_cycle_length`, `repeat_customers`, `customer_objections`,
`support_questions`, `email_examples`, and the four `*_contact_list` variants
land under `other` until each earns its own processing behaviour.

## 6.1 Company identity

```text
company_name
legal_name
website
headquarters_country
city
founded_year
industry
sub_industry
employee_count
business_model
main_language
sales_regions_current

```

## 6.2 Company positioning

```

## 6.5 Current contact data

Customers should be able to upload:

```text

supplier_contact_list
```

Fields:

```text

# 7. API Route Structure

Base API prefix:

```text
/api/v1
```

---

## 7.1 Auth routes

```text
POST   /api/v1/auth/login
POST   /api/v1/auth/logout
GET    /api/v1/auth/me
POST   /api/v1/auth/refresh
POST   /api/v1/auth/password-reset/request
POST   /api/v1/auth/password-reset/confirm
```

Customer users are created by admin, not through open signup.

---

## 7.2 Admin company management

```text
GET    /api/v1/admin/companies
POST   /api/v1/admin/companies
GET    /api/v1/admin/companies/:companyId
PATCH  /api/v1/admin/companies/:companyId
DELETE /api/v1/admin/companies/:companyId

POST   /api/v1/admin/companies/:companyId/activate
POST   /api/v1/admin/companies/:companyId/disable
POST   /api/v1/admin/companies/:companyId/suspend
```

---

## 7.3 Admin user management

```text
GET    /api/v1/admin/users
POST   /api/v1/admin/users
GET    /api/v1/admin/users/:userId
PATCH  /api/v1/admin/users/:userId
DELETE /api/v1/admin/users/:userId

POST   /api/v1/admin/users/:userId/assign-company
POST   /api/v1/admin/users/:userId/reset-password
POST   /api/v1/admin/users/:userId/disable

GET    /api/v1/admin/errors
GET    /api/v1/admin/logs
```

The error and log views are administrator-only, cross-workspace operational
summaries. Responses must omit credentials, message bodies, and other secrets.

---

## 7.4 Company profile routes

```text
GET    /api/v1/company/profile
PATCH  /api/v1/company/profile

GET    /api/v1/company/positioning
PATCH  /api/v1/company/positioning

GET    /api/v1/company/sales-preferences
PATCH  /api/v1/company/sales-preferences
```

---

## 7.5 Company onboarding routes

```text
GET    /api/v1/onboarding/status
POST   /api/v1/onboarding/start
PATCH  /api/v1/onboarding/company-identity
PATCH  /api/v1/onboarding/positioning
PATCH  /api/v1/onboarding/products
PATCH  /api/v1/onboarding/internal-sales-data
PATCH  /api/v1/onboarding/current-contacts
PATCH  /api/v1/onboarding/target-markets
PATCH  /api/v1/onboarding/integrations
PATCH  /api/v1/onboarding/brain-review
POST   /api/v1/onboarding/complete
```

`current-contacts`, `integrations`, and `brain-review` persist WebUI progress.
The original five data-bearing steps remain the completion compatibility
boundary for existing API clients.

---

## 7.6 Document upload routes

```text
GET    /api/v1/documents
POST   /api/v1/documents/upload
GET    /api/v1/documents/:documentId
DELETE /api/v1/documents/:documentId

POST   /api/v1/documents/:documentId/process
GET    /api/v1/documents/:documentId/processing-status
```

Document types:

```text
product_catalog
technical_sheet
price_list
past_sales
past_customers
current_contacts
proposal_example
pitch_deck
certificate
case_study
dealer_list
distributor_list
lost_deals
other
```

### Upload lifecycle

An upload enters **Processing** automatically. The customer never has to ask
for it and never waits on it: `POST /documents/upload` returns as soon as the
file itself is durable, and the work continues behind the response.

The document's status is exactly one of `uploaded`, `processing`, `ready`,
`needs_attention`, `failed` — rendered as Uploaded, Processing, Ready, Needs
attention, Failed. `status_detail` is a plain sentence telling the customer
what to do next, never a technical reason. It stays inside this vocabulary in
every customer surface and in every agent-authored customer response.

Two forms of every document are retained: the original exactly as uploaded, and
an internal prepared artifact the agent reads instead. Everything runs on the
machine that holds the file — no uploaded content is sent to any hosted parser.

`POST /documents/:documentId/process` is a *separate* concern: it starts the
semantic extraction run that turns a Ready document into records. It requires
`ready` and answers `409` with product-safe copy otherwise. That run's success
or failure never changes the document's own status — a file that is usable
stays Ready even if extraction found nothing. Re-running replaces the records
derived from that document rather than duplicating them.

---

## 7.6a Admin document routes

Admin-only, cross-tenant, and the only place implementation detail is visible.

```text
GET    /api/v1/admin/documents
GET    /api/v1/admin/documents/:documentId
GET    /api/v1/admin/documents/:documentId/artifacts/:role     role = original | processed
POST   /api/v1/admin/documents/:documentId/retry
DELETE /api/v1/admin/documents/:documentId

GET    /api/v1/admin/agent-runs/:runId/detail
```

Administrators can preview and download both stored forms (the sidecar is
labelled "Processed (.md) artifact"), read every processing attempt with its
technical reason code, see the extracted records and rejects, and inspect the
run's final structured output together with the sources it consulted.

Artifact bytes are streamed, never embedded in JSON, and the local mirror is
checksum-verified and rebuilt from the database on the way out — losing the
disk costs a re-materialize, not the document.

Agent evidence is redacted before it is stored: credentials, prompt internals,
and raw tool arguments never reach these responses.

## 7.21 WhatsApp integration routes

```text
GET    /api/v1/integrations/whatsapp
POST   /api/v1/integrations/whatsapp/connect
GET    /api/v1/integrations/whatsapp/profile

POST   /api/v1/integrations/whatsapp/webhook
```

The profile routes persist non-secret WhatsApp Business identifiers separately
from server-managed credentials. Profile verification is a readiness check; it
does not prove live Meta API access.

---

# 8. Frontend Structure

This section describes the interface that exists. It previously specified a
React application under `apps/web/src/features/*` with one route and one
component folder per API area. That was never built, and the interface that
shipped in its place is a different shape — so the spec is written from the
code rather than kept as a plan nobody is following.

## 8.1 Repo structure

```text
interfaze-agent/
  server/
    webui/            the customer and admin interface
      index.html
      css/            tokens.css, fonts.css, app.css, caret.css
      fonts/          self-hosted woff2, Turkish diacritics verified
      js/
        main.js       route table, auth wiring, legacy redirects
        router.js     hash router
        shell.js      nav, header, run/approval badges
        api.js        every endpoint, as a named method -> [verb, path] map
        adapters.js   API payloads -> view models
        state.js      view-model store
        real-state.js live backend state
        research-state.js
        session.js    token, company scope, home route
        ui.js         primitives, status vocabulary
        icons.js  catalog.js  caret.js  oauth-popup.js
        agent-bridge.js  hermes-client.js
        pages/        one module per route, plus shared page parts
      PRODUCT.md      design context: register, users, brand, principles
      DESIGN.md       type, colour, spacing, component rules

  agent/              agent runtime
  server/lead_research/  discovery, scoring, evidence, facts
  server/routes/      the /api/v1 surface in section 7
  server/email_providers/
  gateway/  tools/  skills/  providers/  docs/
```

Two deliberate choices, both of which the earlier plan got wrong:

**No build step and no framework.** The interface is vanilla ES modules served
straight from FastAPI, so a page is a file the browser fetches. There is no
bundler, no `node_modules` in the serving path, and no compile stage between
editing a page and reloading it. What buys that is a small enough surface — six
customer routes — that a component framework would cost more in machinery than
it returns in leverage.

**The design spec lives next to the interface, not here.** This file is an
engineering spec: routes, contracts, order of work. Register, users, brand,
voice, accessibility commitments and component rules are in
`server/webui/PRODUCT.md` and `server/webui/DESIGN.md`, which is where the
design tooling looks for them.

## 8.2 Frontend route structure

```text
/
  /login
  /access-pending

/app
  /today                    the operator's morning: what ran, what needs them
  /approvals                the outbound queue; nothing leaves without it
  /research                 campaign results, evidence-first
  /research/new             the brief: markets, sector, what a good lead weighs
  /setup                    company, brain, products, markets, mailbox, sending
  /analytics                reachable from Today, deliberately off the nav

/admin
  /dashboard
  /companies
  /companies/:companyId
  /users
  /agent-runs
  /agent-runs/:runId
  /documents
  /documents/:documentId
  /analytics
  /integrations
  /errors
  /logs
  /data-sources
  /research-quality
  /research
  /research/new
  /research/:campaignId
  /research/:campaignId/edit
```

**Four customer destinations, not sixteen.** The nav is Today, Approvals,
Research, Setup. The earlier route list gave every API area its own page, which
produced a menu longer than the job: an export sales director does not navigate
to "Contacts" and then to "Leads" and then to "Outreach", he works one queue in
the morning and reads results in the afternoon. Analytics is a real page but
answers a question asked occasionally, so it is linked from Today rather than
holding a permanent nav slot.

What the collapse absorbed, and where each thing went:

```text
/app/dashboard          -> /app/today
/app/onboarding         -> /app/setup
/app/company-brain      -> /app/setup?section=brain
/app/integrations       -> /app/setup?section=mailbox
/app/email-templates    -> /app/setup?section=email-style
/app/settings           -> /app/setup?section=sending
/app/leads              -> /app/research
/app/leads/:leadId      -> /app/research
/app/contacts           -> /app/research
/app/contacts/:id       -> /app/research
/app/buyers             -> /app/research
/app/custom-outreach    -> /app/research
/app/lead-map           -> /app/research
/app/outreach           -> /app/approvals
/app/outreach/campaigns/:id -> /app/approvals
/app/agent-runs         -> /app/today   (the log viewer is admin-only now)
```

These redirects are shipped, not documentation: `LEGACY_REDIRECTS` in
`main.js`, each carrying whatever context the new destination can use — a
message id opens that email in the review queue, a lead id expands that
company.

**The map is a component, not a page.** Section 2 promises map-based country
selection and it is delivered, but as the target-markets control inside Setup
and the country strip on Today, rendered by `pages/lead-map.js`. A whole screen
whose only job is picking at most five countries did not earn a nav slot. The
`/lead-map` API routes in section 7.9 are unchanged and still back it.

**Research configuration is admin machinery.** Scoring weights, enrichment
profiles and model profiles sit under `/admin/research`, because they are
operator settings rather than customer decisions. What the customer owns is the
brief at `/app/research/new` — which markets, which sector, what a good lead
weighs — and the results.

# 9. Frontend Modules

One module per route under `server/webui/js/pages/`, plus shared parts. This
replaces the per-feature `components/hooks/services` folders specified earlier:
with no framework there are no hooks, and the services layer is one file
(`api.js`) for the whole application rather than one per feature.

## 9.1 Page modules

```text
pages/
  login.js               credentials, error states
  access-pending.js      a user with no active company
  today.js               run activity, recommended actions, country strip
  approvals.js           the outbound queue, fully keyboard-operable
  research-results.js    campaign results, scores, evidence, contact discovery
  research-brief.js      the customer's lead-search brief
  setup.js               company, positioning, products, documents, brain,
                         markets, mailbox, email style, sending rules
  analytics.js           sales pipeline and market intelligence
  admin.js               dashboard, companies, users, analytics, integrations,
                         errors, logs, data sources, research quality
  admin-documents.js     cross-tenant document list and detail
  agent-runs.js          run detail for admins
  research.js            admin campaign list
  research-editor.js     admin campaign create/edit
  research-detail.js     admin campaign detail
```

## 9.2 Shared page parts

```text
pages/
  _components.js            tables, filters, badges, drawers
  _page-utils.js            formatting, query-state, polling helpers
  lead-map.js               the world map renderer (Setup, Today)
  research-evidence.js      claim + source rendering (Approvals, Research)
  research-scoring.js       weight editor (brief, admin editor)
  research-enrichment.js    enrichment settings (admin editor)
  research-source-picker.js source selection (admin editor)
```

A shared part is a file that more than one page imports. A page module that
nothing routes to and nothing imports is dead code, and is deleted rather than
kept for a future that has not asked for it.

## 9.3 The layers under the pages

```text
api.js          one named method per endpoint, e.g.
                'leadMap.selectCountry': ['POST', '/lead-map/selected-countries']
adapters.js     API payloads -> view models; the only place field names are
                translated between the backend contract and the interface
state.js        view-model store, reset on sign-out
real-state.js   live backend state and its subscriptions
research-state.js  campaign-scoped state
session.js      token, refresh, company scope, home route by role
shell.js        nav, header, badges for pending runs and approvals
ui.js           primitives and the shared status vocabulary
```

Two rules hold across all of it, both of them product commitments rather than
style preferences:

**Unknown renders as unknown.** `ui.js` owns the status vocabulary
(`unknown: 'Not known'`), and no page substitutes a zero or a plausible guess
for a value the backend reported as missing. This is the interface half of the
honesty rule in the scoring engine.

**Evidence is always reachable.** Any score, claim or lead can be opened to the
source it came from, in the original language alongside the English. That is
what the customer is paying for, and it is why `research-evidence.js` is shared
by both the queue and the results rather than reimplemented in each.

## 9.4 Where the product UI lives

`server/webui` is the interface this repository serves and the upstream source
of record for it. The customer-facing deployment is built from it in
`interagent-web`; changes belong here first.
