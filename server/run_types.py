"""Registry of durable agent run types (PRODUCT.md §7.24) → skill + prompt.

Each run type maps to a skill in skills/sales/ and a prompt builder that turns
the run payload into the agent instruction. The company pack directory is
injected so the agent reads that tenant's identity/rules/templates.

This is the single source of truth the dispatcher uses; adding a run type is
one entry here, not a code change elsewhere.
